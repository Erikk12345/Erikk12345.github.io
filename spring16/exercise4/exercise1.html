        <h1><center>Menu descriptions that make me salivate</center></h1>
       
		I love the <strong>deliciousness</strong> of certain words—the way something as ordinary as chocolate can take on an entire new personality when dressed up with adjectives like warm, rich, thick, gooey, chilled, creamy, or frothy. 
		Such descriptive words bring everyday foods to life.
		Magazine writers, cookbook editors, food bloggers, and restaurant reviewers are experts at describing a food. They definitely know the value of a well-turned phrase! Using appetizing words like simmering, hearty, robust, browned, and spicy, they tempt the reader 															        to try a new recipe or visit an out-of-the-way cafe with enticing offerings like these:
        
        <p>I study menus every night, so I should be immune to their literary charms. However, a few well chosen words can hook me like a fish going after a brightly colored lure.
		Menus that merely list ingredients, and that seems to be a growing trend, are missing out on prime marketing opportunities. The right adjectives can create positive enticements for diners to order a particular dish.</p>
        	<h2><center>Roasted</center></h2>
            <p>Baked may have the same meaning, but it sounds like a technique you’d learn in home ec class, while roasted conjures up thoughts of bold, rustic flavors and succulent textures. Add salt in front of the word — as in “salt-roasted” — and it will have a 100 								     		percent return rate in my book. Or try oak-roasted, spit-roasted or pan-roasted, to name a few variations. Gotta order it. Example: Pan-roasted Alaskan halibut, seared baby artichokes, niçoise olives, marjoram, pepperonata and fava beans. Solbar, Calistoga.</		            p>

		<h2>Roasted</h2>
        <ul>
        	<li>Place fish in an 11 x 7-inch baking dish coated with cooking spray</li>
        	<li>Combine lime juice</li>
        	<li>mayonnaise</li>
        	<li>onion powder</li>
        	<li>pepper in a small bowl</li>
        	<li>spread over fish</li>
        	<li><em>Bake at 425° for 20 minutes or until fish flakes easily when tested with a fork.</em></li>
        </ul>
        </div>
            <h3><center>Spicy and cool</center></h3>
            <p>The juxtaposition of two seemingly opposite terms is always good for a Pavlovian response. Example: Spicy sauteed wild prawns with garlic and herbs; Cool cucumber salad with dill, yogurt and couscous. Palio d’Asti, San Francisco</p>
            <p>I know this is a ingredient, but when they’re on the menu, I want to order them. They’re a walk on the wild side. Will they be spicy or mild? It’s like playing Russian roulette with your food. I feel the same way about padron peppers. Example: Pork jowl with shishito and tare. Nojo, San Francisco. Or a double salivate: Butter- roasted Alaskan halibut with yellow corn, chickpeas, shishito peppers, bacon, summer beans and sweet onion sauce. Txoko, San Francisco. Or: Blistered shishito peppers wit</p>

       <h3>Delicious and Nutritious</h3>
       <p>Low-fat fish provides a quality replacement for fatty meats. The protein in fish supplies your body with necessary building blocks that help your physical and mental health. Fish also contains plenty of vitamins and minerals. Riboflavin and vitamins B2 and D help transport calcium into the bones. Health-boosting minerals include iron, zinc, potassium, calcium, and selenium.

		<h3>All About Omega-3s</h3>
        <p>Perhaps the most important advantage of eating fish comes from the omega-3 fatty acids in both finfish and shellfish. According to the <strong><em>Cleveland Clinic</em></strong>, omega-3s help protect against heart disease and may help lower your blood pressure. They also have anti-inflammatory properties.</p>

<h3>Types of fish that contain the most omega-3s include:</h3>
		<div class="type">
		<ul>
        	<li>tuna</li>
        	<li>mackerel</li>
			<li>salmon</li>
			<li>sardines</li>
			<li>herring</li>
			<li>trout</li>
      	</ul>

		<h3><center>How does fish affect our health?</center></h3>
It has been proven that fish meat and fish oil, both considered as part of our regular diet, reduce the probability of heart attack, protect bones, prevent the occurrence of cancer and slow down the aging process.
Here are some diseases and pains against which fish acts like a medicine:
Acne, anemia, blood vessel disease, heart disease, obesity, memory loss, depression, impotence, some types of cancer, infertility, insomnia, osteoporosis, increased blood pressure, premenstrual syndrome, skin problems, menopausal problems, problems in pregnancy, chronic fatigue syndrome, decreased blood levels of triglycerides, stress, hypertension and slows down the aging process.
Eventhough fish is considered as healthy food, some people seem to be hypersensitive to fish and they should avoid eating fish. In situations like this, you should consult your doctor and ask for advice about the way you should consume the required nutrients in regular amounts.</p>

        <h3>Longevity Link</h3>
        <p><strong>Omega-3s</strong> may also help increase your lifespan, research shows. According to MedlinePlus, a study of over 2,600 older adults found that those who had the highest blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids lived on average more than two years longer than those with lower levels of omega-3s.

Study participants with the highest omega-3 levels reduced their risk of dying from any cause up to 27 percent compared with those who had lower levels.</p>
