	<h2>What is a Salmon?</h2>
    	<p>Salmon are fish. That's pretty basic. But . . . what is a fish, exactly?</p><br />
It's a cold-blooded, water dwelling vertebrate with gills, fins, and a body that is usually covered with scales. They breathe with gills, which are covered by opercula. They can sense their environment in a variety of ways. Along what is called the lateral line, fish have sensors that detect motion, vibration, and sound. Salmon also have an excellent sense of smell.

Did you know that the two comma-shaped holes on either side of a salmon's head are its noses? These olfactory receptors absorb molecules from water that convey information to the fish about its environment.

Most fish live in either salt water or fresh. But some fish are diadromous (dye-AD-ruh-mus) â€” they can live in fresh and salt water, at different times in their lives. Catadromous fish are born in salt water, move to fresh water to feed, and return to salt water to spawn (lay their eggs). Anadromous (ah-NAD-ruh-mus) fish begin their lives in fresh water, move to salt water to feed, and return to fresh water to spawn.
